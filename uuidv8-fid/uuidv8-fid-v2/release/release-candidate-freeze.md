# Release Candidate Freeze

This document is explicitly non-normative. It does not declare a final release.

## Purpose

This document defines what the "release-candidate freeze" means for UUIDv8-FID-v2. The freeze establishes a strict review boundary to allow humans to review the complete publication package before any future final-release decision is made.

## Status

Current milestone: Split-Canonical Publication Simplification.
Next gate: Final Publication Decision Gate.
This stride adds derived release-readiness material for making that future decision.
Decision status: pending.

See derived release-readiness material:
* `final-publication-decision-gate.md`
* `final-publication-decision-checklist.md`
* `final-publication-preflight-record.md`
* `final-publication-decision-summary.md`

## Freeze Principles

* **Canonical Specification**: The canonical specification remains the split files under the `uuidv8-fid-v2/` directory.
* **Review Boundary**: The freeze is purely a review boundary, not a final release.
* **Publication Package**: The publication candidate package is strictly defined by `publication/publication-candidate-manifest.md`.
* **Package Verification**: The package verification checklist is defined by `publication/publication-package-verification.md`.
* **Change Semantics**: After the freeze, any changes to canonical specification files should be treated as requiring a new review pass.
* **Derived Material**: Changes to derived publication/release/tooling material may still occur, but must preserve the freeze boundary and must strictly not alter normative semantics.
* **Split-Canonical Publication**: The split Markdown files are the canonical source and the only maintained publication form. Generated single-file documents are not committed.
* **No Rendered HTML**: No rendered HTML package artifact is part of the freeze or committed to the repository.
* **No CI**: No CI workflow is introduced by this freeze.

## Frozen review boundary

| Area | Included? | Role | Review expectation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Canonical split specification | Yes | Core normative text | Full review of invariants and semantics |
| Registry and format-specific files | Yes | Normative specification | Full review of registry semantics and format constraints |
| Conformance material | Yes | Structural validation cases | Ensuring exact expected vectors |
| Implementation support material | Yes | Language-neutral pseudocode | Verification of correct algorithmic logic |
| Publication candidate package documents | Yes | Package bounds | Ensuring exact file inclusion |
| Release-readiness documents | Yes | Human checkpoints | Completing checklists and reviews |
| Local tooling | Yes | Consistency enforcement | Execution yielding zero errors |
| Generated single-file artifact | No | Generated on demand only | Not committed |
| Other generated/HTML artifacts | No | Build products or unauthorized generated outputs | Must remain completely absent |
