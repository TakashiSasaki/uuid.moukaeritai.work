# Human Review Record

This document is explicitly non-normative. It does not declare a final release.

## Purpose

This document provides a structured manual review record template for the release candidate. It verifies core specification invariants, bounds, and exclusions.

## Status

Current milestone: Split-Canonical Publication Simplification.
Next gate: Final Publication Decision Gate.
This stride adds derived release-readiness material for making that future decision.
Decision status: pending.

See derived release-readiness material:
* `final-publication-decision-gate.md`
* `final-publication-decision-checklist.md`
* `final-publication-preflight-record.md`
* `final-publication-decision-summary.md`

## Review Checklists

### Specification invariants

- [ ] Bit layout is unchanged.
- [ ] Validation semantics are unchanged.

### Registry invariants

- [ ] `0x10` remains the only assigned concrete Format ID.
- [ ] `0x11..0xef` remains unassigned.
- [ ] `0x00..0x0f` remains reserved.
- [ ] `0xf0..0xff` remains reserved.
- [ ] `0x7a` remains an unassigned extraction/conformance example only.

### Conformance vectors

- [ ] Conformance vector outcomes are unchanged.

### Implementation pseudocode

- [ ] Implementation pseudocode behavior is unchanged.

### Publication package boundary

- [ ] Publication candidate manifest is current.
- [ ] Publication package verification checklist is reviewed.

### Generated artifact invariants

- [ ] Exactly one generated single-file specification artifact is committed at the allowed path.
- [ ] The generated artifact exactly matches regenerated output.
- [ ] No other generated single-file specification artifact is committed.
- [ ] No rendered HTML package artifact is committed.

### CI workflow absence

- [ ] No CI workflow was added for this stride.

### Local command execution

- [ ] `python uuidv8-fid-v2/tools/check_consistency.py` exits with 0 and prints PASS.
- [ ] `python uuidv8-fid-v2/tools/check_consistency.py --fail-on-warnings` exits with 0 and prints PASS.
- [ ] `python uuidv8-fid-v2/tools/test_check_consistency.py` exits with 0 and prints PASS.

### Known non-goals

- [ ] The core goals remain non-normative.
- [ ] No new functional features have been introduced.

### Final-release non-declaration

- [ ] Final release is not declared.
