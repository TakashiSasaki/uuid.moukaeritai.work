# UUIDv8-FID-v2 Publication Readiness Summary

This document is non-normative.
This document does not declare a final release.

The document set is considered close to public-ready when the following are true:

Current milestone: Dual-Form Publication Package Candidate.
Next gate: Final Publication Decision Gate.
This stride adds derived release-readiness material for making that future decision.
Decision status: pending.

See derived release-readiness material:
* `final-publication-decision-gate.md`
* `final-publication-decision-checklist.md`
* `final-publication-preflight-record.md`
* `final-publication-decision-summary.md`

* canonical specification sections are present;
* registry is internally consistent;
* `0x10 time48-rand` is documented;
* conformance vectors exist in Markdown and JSON;
* local consistency tooling passes;
* reader guide and source map are present;
* top-level entry points remain non-normative;
* exactly one generated single-file publication artifact is allowed, and it is not treated as source of truth.

Area | Status | Notes
--- | --- | ---
Canonical specification | ready with checks | Canonical split sections are present and should be checked with the local consistency tool before publication.
Registry | ready with checks | The registry currently assigns only `0x10 time48-rand`, leaves `0x11..0xef` unassigned, and reserves `0x00..0x0f` and `0xf0..0xff`.
time48-rand format | ready with checks | The first concrete format is documented and covered by deterministic examples and conformance material.
Conformance vectors | ready with checks | Markdown and JSON conformance vectors exist and should remain aligned.
Implementation guidance | non-normative support | Pseudocode and checklist material support implementers but do not redefine the specification.
Audit material | non-normative support | Audit checklists and release-readiness notes support review and do not introduce normative requirements.
Publication guidance | non-normative support | Reader guide, source map, assembly plan, assembly dry-run, dual-form package details, generated derivative artifact, release-candidate checklist, manifest, and verification document support publication preparation.
Local tooling | ready with checks | Local consistency tooling exists and should pass before treating the document set as a release candidate. Warning-free release-candidate readiness is checked with the strict warning mode.
Release notes | non-normative support | Release-candidate notes describe readiness only and do not declare a final release.
Execution record | non-normative support | Release-candidate execution results are tracked in `release-candidate-execution-record.md`, assembly dry-run results are tracked in `single-file-assembly-dry-run-record.md`, and dual-form results are tracked in `dual-form-publication-verification-record.md`.
Pre-publication sweep | ready with checks | Final local and manual checks are recorded in `pre-publication-sweep.md`.
Release freeze gate | non-normative support | The freeze, gate, and review boundary documents define strict manual review conditions before any final-release decision.
