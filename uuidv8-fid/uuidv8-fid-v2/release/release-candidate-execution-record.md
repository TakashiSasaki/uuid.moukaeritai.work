# UUIDv8-FID-v2 Release-Candidate Execution Record

This document is strictly non-normative and does not declare a final release. The canonical specification remains the split files under `uuidv8-fid-v2/`.

## Status

Current milestone: Dual-Form Publication Package Candidate.
Next gate: Final Publication Decision Gate.
This stride adds derived release-readiness material for making that future decision.
Decision status: pending.

See derived release-readiness material:
- `final-publication-decision-gate.md`
- `final-publication-decision-checklist.md`
- `final-publication-preflight-record.md`
- `final-publication-decision-summary.md`

## Manual Invariant Review

- [x] `0x10` remains the only assigned concrete Format ID
- [x] `0x11..0xef` remains unassigned
- [x] `0x00..0x0f` remains reserved
- [x] `0xf0..0xff` remains reserved
- [x] `0x7a` remains an unassigned extraction/conformance example only
- [x] top-level stubs remain non-normative
- [x] final release is not declared
- [x] exactly one generated single-file specification artifact exists at the allowed path
- [x] no other generated single-file artifact exists
- [x] no CI workflow was added in this stride

## Limitations

This document is an execution and release-readiness record only. It does not change any specification semantics or introduce normative requirements.
